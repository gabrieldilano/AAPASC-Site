            Powering unity among students, the Asian/Asian Pacific American Student Coalition (AAPASC) at ASU is a thriving community fostering cultural pride and solidarity. Through an open, collaborative platform, AAPASC connects students of Asian and Pacific Islander descent, offering a space to celebrate heritage and discuss shared experiences. The coalition links various cultural organizations and gathers input from students to provide richer, more contextual programming that addresses unique challenges and promotes awareness.

            Delivering enriching cultural experiences without the complexity of navigating diverse backgrounds alone, AAPASC accelerates student engagement and community involvement. By hosting events, workshops, and cultural celebrations, AAPASC eliminates isolation, empowers students, and facilitates seamless integration into the campus community.
